Problem: LeetCode 207 - Course Schedule

Description:
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.
For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

Intuition:
This problem can be approached as a graph problem where the courses represent nodes and the prerequisites represent directed edges. To determine if it is possible to finish all courses, we need to check if there is a cycle in the graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a dependency loop, and we cannot finish all the courses.

Approach:
1. Build an adjacency list representation of the graph using the prerequisites.
2. Initialize a visited array to track the visited nodes during the DFS traversal.
3. Iterate through each node in the graph and perform a DFS traversal to detect cycles:
   - If the current node is being visited, it means there is a cycle, so return false.
   - If the current node is not visited, perform a DFS traversal on its neighbors.
4. If no cycles are detected after the DFS traversal, return true.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity is O(V + E), where V is the number of courses (nodes) and E is the number of prerequisites (edges). We visit each course and prerequisite once.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(V + E), where V is the number of courses (nodes) and E is the number of prerequisites (edges). This is the space used for the adjacency list and the visited array.
