Problem: LeetCode 70 - Climbing Stairs

Description:
You are climbing a staircase that has n steps. You can either climb 1 or 2 steps at a time.
Return the number of distinct ways to climb to the top.

Intuition:
To reach the nth step, we can either take a single step from the (n-1)th step or take two steps from the (n-2)th step.
This forms the basis of our dynamic programming approach, as we can break down the problem into subproblems and build the solution from there.

Approach:
1. Initialize an array dp of size (n+1) to store the number of distinct ways to reach each step.
2. Set the base cases: dp[0] = 1 (no steps needed) and dp[1] = 1 (one step to reach the first step).
3. Iterate from 2 to n:
   - Compute dp[i] by summing up the number of ways to reach the previous two steps: dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2].
4. Return dp[n], which represents the number of distinct ways to reach the top step.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity is O(n) since we iterate through the steps once.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n) since we use an array of size (n+1) to store the intermediate results.

Dynamic Programming:
- Subproblem: The subproblem is finding the number of distinct ways to reach the current step.
- Recurrence Relation: dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2], where dp[i] represents the number of distinct ways to reach the ith step.
- Base Case: dp[0] = 1 and dp[1] = 1, as there is only one way to reach the first two steps.
