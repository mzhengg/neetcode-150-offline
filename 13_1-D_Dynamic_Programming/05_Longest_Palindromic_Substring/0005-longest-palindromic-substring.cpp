Problem: LeetCode 5 - Longest Palindromic Substring

Description:
Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

Intuition:
To find the longest palindromic substring, we can consider dynamic programming.
A palindrome reads the same backward as forward, so we can use this property to solve the problem.
We define a 2D array dp, where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring from index i to j is a palindrome.
Using this definition, we can build the solution by considering smaller subproblems and expanding from there.

Approach:
1. Create a 2D boolean array dp of size (n x n), where n is the length of the input string s.
   - dp[i][j] will be true if the substring from index i to j is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
2. Initialize the base cases:
   - Set dp[i][i] to true, as single characters are palindromes.
   - Set dp[i][i+1] to true if s[i] is equal to s[i+1], as two identical characters are palindromes.
3. Iterate over the substring lengths from 3 to n:
   - Iterate over the starting index i from 0 to n - len:
     - Calculate the ending index j as i + len - 1.
     - Update dp[i][j] to true if s[i] is equal to s[j] and dp[i+1][j-1] is true.
4. Keep track of the longest palindromic substring by updating the start and end indices whenever a longer palindrome is found.
5. Return the substring from the start index to the end index.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string s. We iterate over the dp array, which has a size of n x n.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n^2) as well. We use a 2D array dp of size n x n to store the intermediate results.

Dynamic Programming:
- Subproblem: The subproblem is determining whether a substring from index i to j is a palindrome.
- Recurrence Relation: dp[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j]) && dp[i+1][j-1], where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring from index i to j is a palindrome.
- Base Case: dp[i][i] = true (single character is a palindrome) and dp[i][i+1] = (s[i] == s[i+1]) (two identical characters are a palindrome).
