Problem: LeetCode 211 - Design Add and Search Words Data Structure

Description:
Design a data structure that supports adding new words and finding if a string matches any previously added string.
The word may contain only lowercase alphabets '.' or be an empty string.

Intuition:
To solve this problem, we can use a Trie data structure to store the words. The Trie allows efficient insertion and search operations. For the '.' character, we need to consider all possible characters at that position.

Approach:
1. TrieNode:
   - Define a TrieNode class that represents each node in the Trie.
   - Each TrieNode has an array of pointers to child nodes, representing the lowercase alphabets and the '.' character.
   - Each TrieNode also has a boolean flag to indicate if it represents a complete word.

2. WordDictionary:
   - Define a WordDictionary class that contains the root of the Trie.
   - Implement the addWord method to add a word to the Trie:
     - Start from the root and iterate over each character in the word.
     - For each character, check if the corresponding child node exists. If not, create a new node and link it to the current node.
     - Move to the child node and repeat the process for the next character.
     - After iterating through all characters, mark the last node as a complete word.
   - Implement the search method to search for a word in the Trie:
     - Start from the root and iterate over each character in the word.
     - For each character, check if the corresponding child node exists. If not, return false.
     - Move to the child node and repeat the process for the next character.
     - After iterating through all characters, check if the last node represents a complete word.
   - Implement the searchWithWildcard method to search for a word with wildcard characters ('.') in the Trie:
     - Use a recursive approach to search for the word.
     - If the current character is a wildcard ('.'), iterate over all possible child nodes and recursively search for the remaining word.
     - If the current character is not a wildcard, check if the corresponding child node exists and recursively search for the remaining word.
     - Return true if any of the recursive searches return true.
     - Return false if no matching word is found.

Time Complexity:
- Adding a word: O(m), where m is the length of the word being added.
- Searching a word: O(m), where m is the length of the word being searched.
- Searching a word with wildcard: O(n*m), where n is the number of words in the Trie and m is the length of the word being searched.

Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(n*m), where n is the number of words added to the Trie and m is the average length of the words.
