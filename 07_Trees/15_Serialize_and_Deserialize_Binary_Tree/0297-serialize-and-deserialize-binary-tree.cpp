Problem: LeetCode 297 - Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

Description:
Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. Serialize means to encode a tree structure into a string representation, and deserialize means to decode the string representation back into a binary tree structure. The encoded string should be as compact as possible.

Intuition:
To serialize a binary tree, we can perform a pre-order traversal and encode the tree structure into a string. We use a special character to represent nullptr or empty nodes. During deserialization, we can use the encoded string to reconstruct the binary tree.

Approach:
1. Serialization:
   - Perform a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.
   - When encountering a non-empty node, append its value to the serialized string, followed by a separator.
   - When encountering a nullptr or empty node, append a special character (e.g., 'N') to represent it.
   - Use a separator character (e.g., ',') to separate the values in the serialized string.

2. Deserialization:
   - Split the serialized string by the separator to obtain an array of values.
   - Create a queue to hold the values from the array.
   - Recursively build the binary tree using a helper function:
     - If the queue is empty or the current value is the special character, return nullptr.
     - Create a new node with the current value.
     - Pop the queue to move to the next value.
     - Set the left child of the current node by recursively calling the helper function.
     - Set the right child of the current node by recursively calling the helper function.
     - Return the current node.
   - Call the helper function with the queue to build the binary tree.
   - Return the root of the binary tree.

Time Complexity:
- Serialization: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We perform a pre-order traversal to serialize the tree.
- Deserialization: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We iterate through the serialized string to deserialize and reconstruct the tree.

Space Complexity:
- Serialization: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. The serialized string requires space proportional to the number of nodes.
- Deserialization: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We use a queue to store the values during deserialization.
