## What is NeetCode 150?

Neetcode 150 is a curated list of 150 LeetCode problems designed to cover all topics in data structures. It is an invaluable resource to study for LeetCode-style interviews you might enounter at FAANG and other big tech companies.

## Purpose of The Project

Sometimes, it may be inconvenient to code because you are on the go or you simply want to brush up on your CS skills by reading about it - This let's you do just that! LeetCoding relies on understanding a fundemental set of data structures and algorithmic concepts and then applying them to different problem scenarios. Therefore, in theory, by regularly refreshing yourself on the topics in this book, you will maintain a solid understanding of DSA. Then, when a technical interview is approaching, one should be able to jump straight into Leetcode to practice real problems from scratch with minimal difficulty. This is just an idea, I could be horribly wrong about this c:
