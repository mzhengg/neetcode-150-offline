Problem: LeetCode 10 - Regular Expression Matching

Description:
Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:
- '.' Matches any single character.
- '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Intuition:
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can break down the problem into smaller subproblems and use a 2D DP table to store the results of these subproblems.

Approach:
1. Create a 2D DP table of size (s.length() + 1) x (p.length() + 1), where s.length() and p.length() are the lengths of the input string "s" and pattern "p", respectively.
   - dp[i][j] represents whether the substring s[0...i-1] matches the pattern p[0...j-1].
2. Initialize the DP table:
   - dp[0][0] represents whether an empty string matches an empty pattern, which is true. So, dp[0][0] = true.
   - dp[i][0] represents whether an empty string matches the pattern p[0...i-1]. For all i > 0, dp[i][0] is false because a non-empty pattern cannot match an empty string.
   - For dp[0][j], we need to handle patterns with '*', which means we should check if p[j-1] is '*' and if there's a valid pattern before it. If yes, then dp[0][j] will have the same result as dp[0][j-2].
3. Fill in the DP table by considering the following cases:
   - If p[j-1] is a regular character or '.', we need to check if s[i-1] matches p[j-1]. If yes, then dp[i][j] will be true if dp[i-1][j-1] is true.
   - If p[j-1] is '*', we have two sub-cases:
     a) If the character before '*' in the pattern (p[j-2]) matches the current character in the string (s[i-1]) or it is '.', then we have two options:
        - Ignore the '*' and the preceding character in the pattern: dp[i][j] will be true if dp[i][j-2] is true.
        - Consider the '*' and the preceding character in the pattern: dp[i][j] will be true if dp[i-1][j] is true and s[i-1] matches the preceding character in the pattern (p[j-2]).
4. The final answer will be stored in dp[s.length()][p.length()], representing whether the entire string "s" matches the entire pattern "p".

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the DP solution is O(s.length() * p.length()), where s.length() and p.length() are the lengths of the input string "s" and pattern "p", respectively. We fill in the entire DP table of size (s.length() + 1) x (p.length() + 1).

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the DP solution is O(s.length() * p.length()), where s.length() and p.length() are the lengths of the input string "s" and pattern "p", respectively. We use a 2D DP table to store the results of subproblems.

Dynamic Programming:
- Subproblem: The subproblem is whether a substring s[0...i-1] matches a pattern p[0...j-1].
- Recurrence Relation: The result for dp[i][j] depends on whether s[i-1] matches p[j-1] and the results of previous subproblems (dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-2]).
- Base Case: The base cases are dp[0][0], dp[i][0] (for all i > 0), and dp[0][j] (for patterns with '*').
