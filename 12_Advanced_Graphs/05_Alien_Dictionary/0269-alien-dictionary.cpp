Problem: LeetCode 269 - Alien Dictionary

Description:
Given a list of words in the alien language, find the order of the characters in this language.

The alien language is represented by a given dictionary, which will have words in an arbitrary order.
Each word consists of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') and will not have duplicate characters.

It is guaranteed that no two words in the dictionary have the same ordering of letters.

If the order is invalid, return an empty string. There may be multiple valid orderings, you should return the smallest one in lexicographical order.

Intuition:
This problem can be solved using topological sorting. The given dictionary represents the relationship between characters in the alien language. The order of characters in the alien language can be determined by their relative positions in the words of the dictionary.

Approach:
1. Create a graph to represent the relationship between characters in the alien language.
2. Traverse the dictionary and add edges to the graph based on the order of characters in adjacent words.
3. Perform topological sorting on the graph to get the order of characters in the alien language.
4. Return the result as a string.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the solution is O(N), where N is the total number of characters in all the words in the dictionary. The reason is that we iterate through each character once to build the graph and perform topological sorting.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the solution is O(1) since we are using a fixed-size array of size 26 to represent the graph.

Topological Sorting:
- Intuition: Topological sorting is used to find the linear order of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge (u, v), vertex u comes before v in the ordering.
- Approach: We use a depth-first search (DFS) based approach to perform topological sorting. We start from a source vertex (a vertex with no incoming edges) and visit its neighbors recursively. After visiting all the neighbors, we add the current vertex to the result stack. The result stack will contain the vertices in the correct order.
