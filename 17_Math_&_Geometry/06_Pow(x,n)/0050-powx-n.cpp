/*
Problem: LeetCode 50 - Pow(x, n)

Description:
Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., x^n).

Intuition:
To calculate the power x^n, we can use the concept of recursion and divide-and-conquer. The idea is to break down the problem into smaller subproblems and solve them recursively.

Approach:
1. First, we handle the base case where n is 0 or 1. If n is 0, the result is 1. If n is 1, the result is x itself.
2. If n is negative, we convert the problem to calculate 1/x raised to the power -n.
3. To calculate x^n, we can divide the problem into two parts:
   - Calculate x^(n/2) using recursion.
   - If n is even, the result is (x^(n/2)) * (x^(n/2)).
   - If n is odd, the result is (x^(n/2)) * (x^(n/2)) * x.
4. We use a helper function to perform the recursive calculations.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(log n) because we are dividing the problem size by 2 in each recursive call.

Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(log n) as well due to the recursive function calls.

        // Base case: x^1 = x

            return x;

        if (n < 0) {

        if (n % 2 != 0) {
            result *= x;
